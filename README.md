<h3>My scalemodeling hobby</h3>
<p> 
This is a project including information for all my scalemodels, tools, paints, consumables, pictures, modelshows participations, etc. In other words, everything connected with my hobby which I love to practice in my free time for more than a decade.
The project includes the data which I collected in Google sheets for all the years. I'm downloading the Google sheets to Json files and then seeding them in SQL database using EF Core, adding all the relations which I didn't have the option to add with Google Sheets.
Later I'm planning to add ASP.Net part for better visualization.

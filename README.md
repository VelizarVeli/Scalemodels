# Scalemodels
My scalemodeling hobby

This is a project including information for all my scalemodels, tools, paints, consumables, pictures, modelshows participations, etc. In other words, everything connected with my hobby which I love to practice in my free time already over a decade.
The project includes the data which I collected in Google sheets for all the years. I'm downloading the sheets to Json files and then seeding them in SQL database using EF Core, adding all the relations which I didn't have the option to add with Google Sheets.
Later I'm planning to add ASP.Net part for better visualization.

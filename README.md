# Scalemodels

<h3>My scalemodeling hobby</h3>
The project includes the data which I collected in Google sheets for all the years. I'm downloading the Google sheets to Json files and then seeding them in SQL database using EF Core, adding all the relations which I didn't have the option to add with Google Sheets.
